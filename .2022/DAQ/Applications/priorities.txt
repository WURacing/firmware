inputs		4
Responsible for sending control signals to shifting and eARB. Safety critical.
Should not have halting risks, 
50ms. 

display		3
Responsible for informing the driver of state and warnings. Safety critical.
Should not have halting risks, assuming i2c peripheral works.
50ms

datalogger	2
Formats and stores incoming data from sensor boards and engine controller. 
Risks: some parts of drv_sd will not time out if SD is badly behaved.
drv_sd functions (i.e. read/write which operate on 512 bytes at a time) might be good candidates for DMA/background operation. Probably not interrupts per byte though because we'd get interrupted every 40 cycles
10ms

telemetry	1
Formats and transmits incoming data from sensor boards and engine controller.
Risks: can't login if already logged in, but otherwise everything times out.
Interrupt driven: sleeps while waiting for data over the UART
